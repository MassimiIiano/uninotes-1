### 1. SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES  
The aim of this course is to present a rather comprehensive treatment of linear algebra and its applications, giving a general overview of the field. It covers vector and matrix theory to some degree of mathematical logic and rigor, emphasizing topics useful in other disciplines such as solving linear equations and computing determinants and eigenvalues of matrices. The course also provides practice in using linear algebra to think about problems in computer science, and in actually using linear algebra computations to address these problems. Below is a list of specific learning outcomes of the course. 
- _Knowledge and understanding_: have a solid knowledge of linear algebra that are in support of computer science.  
- _Applying knowledge and understanding:_ be able to use the tools of mathematics to solve problems.  
- _Making judgments_: be able to work autonomously according to the own level of knowledge and understanding.  
- _Communication skills:_ be able to use one of the three languages English, Italian and German, and be able to use technical terms and communication appropriately.  
-  _Ability to learn:_ have developed learning capabilities to pursue further studies with a high degree of autonomy.

## 4. ASSESSMENT  
### 6 exercises (1 for each topic)
**Final Written Exam, 100% covering the full program.**  

The written exam will consist of a set of verification questions, transfer of knowledge questions and exercises. The aim of the assessment is to check to which degree students have mastered the following learning outcomes: 
1.  knowledge and understanding,
2. applying knowledge and understanding,
3. making judgment. The same rules apply to both attending and non-attending students.  
 
4. Written exam questions will be evaluated in terms of correctness, clarity, quality of argumentation, problem solving ability.   
  
The same rules apply to both attending and non-attending students.
