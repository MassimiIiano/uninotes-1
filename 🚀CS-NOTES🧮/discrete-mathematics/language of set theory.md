## History
Use of the word **set** as a formal mathematical term was introduced in 1879 by **Georg Cantor** (1845â€“1918)

For most mathematical purposes we can think of a set intuitively, simply as a collection of objects, which are elements of it
## Notation
### Sets in general
If $S$ is a set, the notation $x \in S$  means that the object $x$ is an **element** of the set $S$ ; the notation $x \notin S$  means that the object is **not an element** of the set $S$.

A set is completely determined by what its elements are (**axiom of extensionality**). That is, two sets A and B **are equal** iff, for any $x$, we have that $x \in A$ iff $x\in B$ 

Notice that extensionality gives us an identity criterion for sets: two sets are the same exactly when they have the same elements as members.
### set-roster notation
A set may be specified using the set-roster notation by writing all its elements between braces e.g. $\{1,2,3\}$  
Sometimes used for large sets, we can use the *ellipsis* $...$ e.g.$\{1,2,3,...,100\}$ to refer to all the integers from 1 to 100

### fun facts
- Any element can only be once in a set
- single sets and their number are not equal $\{0\}\neq 0$ 
- Wrapping sets is possible e.g. {1, {1}} are 2 distinct elements
