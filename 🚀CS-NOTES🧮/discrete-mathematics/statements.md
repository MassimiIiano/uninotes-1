## Important mathematical statements

**A universal statement** says that a certain property is true for all elements in a collection of objects. (E.g., All positive numbers are greater than -10.)

**A conditional statement** says that if one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true. (E.g., If 378 is divisible by 18, then is divisible by 6 .)

Given a property that may or may not be true, an **existential statement** says that there is at least one thing for which the property is true. (E.g., *There is* a prime number that is even.)
