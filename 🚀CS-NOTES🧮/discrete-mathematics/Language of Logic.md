## Notation of logic
| Operator | Mathematical Equivalent |
|----------|-------------------------|
| not      | ¬ (negation)           |
| and      | ∧ (logical AND)        |
| or       | ∨ (logical OR)         |
## Compound statements
### if ... then ... statemant
**Implication (IF...THEN):** The "if...then..." statement represents a relationship between two propositions where the truth of one proposition (the consequent) depends on the truth of another proposition (the antecedent). It is written as "p → q." For example, "If it is sunny (p), then it is warm (q)" means that when it is sunny, it is also warm.

Truth value of the material implication $p \rightarrow q$ is `false` 
iff $p$ (the antecedent) is `true` but $q$ (the consequence) is `false`.

Examples:
$2+2=5 \rightarrow$ Paris is the capital of Italy is `true` because `false` $\rightarrow$ `false` = `ture`
$2+2=4 \rightarrow$ Paris is the capital of Italy is `false` because `true` $\rightarrow$ `false`= `false` 

h= "it is hot" and s="it is sunny"
it is not hot, but it is sunny $\neg h\land s$   
## Law of Non-Contradiction
for any proposition p is the case that $\neg(p\land\neg p)$
## Implication
Let p and q be propositions. the proposition "if p then q" denoted by $p \rightarrow q$ 

| P | Q | P → Q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   T   |
