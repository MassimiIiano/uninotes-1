## Notation
### Sets in general
If $S$ is a set, the notation $x \in S$  means that the object $x$ is an **element** of the set $S$ ; the notation $x \notin S$  means that the object is **not an element** of the set $S$.

A set is completely determined by what its elements are (**axiom of extensionality**). That is, two sets A and B **are equal** iff, for any $x$, we have that $x \in A$ iff $x\in B$ 

Notice that extensionality gives us an identity criterion for sets: two sets are the same exactly when they have the same elements as members.
### set-roster notation
A set may be specified using the set-roster notation by writing all its elements between braces e.g. $\{1,2,3\}$  
Sometimes used for large sets, we can use the *ellipsis* $...$ e.g.$\{1,2,3,...,100\}$ to refer to all the integers from 1 to 100

### fun facts
- Any element can only be once in a set
- single sets and their number are not equal $\{0\}\neq 0$ 
- Wrapping sets is possible e.g. {1, {1}} are 2 distinct elements

### set-builder notation
Let $S$ denote a set and let $P(x)$ be a property that elements of  $S$ may or may not satisfy. We may define a new set to be the set of all elements in such that $P(x)$ is true
$$
	\{x\in S | P(x) \}
$$

### Cartesian Product
Given the elements `a` and `b`, the notation `(a, b)` denotes the ordered pair consisting of `a` as the first element and `b` as the second element.

Two ordered pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are equal if and only if `a = c` and `b = d`.

Given sets A and B, the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs where 'a' is in A and 'b' is in B.

Symbolically, it can be expressed as:
$$
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A \ \textrm{and} \ b ∈ B}
$$
