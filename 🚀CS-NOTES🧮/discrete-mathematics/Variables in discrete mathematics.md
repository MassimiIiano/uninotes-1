## History
In mathematics, a variable (from Latin variabilis, "changeable") is a symbol that represents a mathematical object

In ancient works such as Euclid's Elements, single letters refer to geometric points and shapes.

In the 7th century, Brahmagupta used different colors to represent the unknowns in algebraic equations in the Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta. One section of this book is called "Equations of Several Colours”.

At the end of the 16th century, François Viète (often known as “Vieta”) introduced the idea of representing known and unknown numbers by letters, nowadays called variables, and the idea of computing with them as if they were numbers—in order to obtain the result by a simple replacement

Viète's convention was to use consonants for known values, and vowels for unknowns.

*In 1637, René Descartes "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c”*
## Existential use
It allows you to give a **temporary name to what you are seeking** so that you can perform concrete computations with it to help discover its possible values.

“Is there a number $x$ with the property that $2x+3=x^2$?”
## Universal use
It allows you to give a temporary name to the (arbitrary) number you might choose so that you can perform concrete computations with it to help check a certain property

"No matter what number $x$ might be chosen, if $x > 2$ , then $x^2 > 4$.”

variables are used to write mathematical [[Statements]]
