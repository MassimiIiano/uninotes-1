## Subsets
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A$ is a **subset** of  $B$, written $A\subseteq B$, if and only if every element $A$ of is also an element of $B$.
Symbolically:
$$
A \subseteq B \qquad \textrm{iff for all objects x, if} \ x \in A\ \textrm{ten} \ x\in B
$$
Note: you can negate the subset symbol $\nsubseteq$ if $A$ is **not** a subset of $B$
We can also say that "A is contained in B" and "B contains A"
### Proper subsets
$$
	A \subset B \Leftrightarrow A \subseteq B \ \textrm{and} \  A \neq B
$$
