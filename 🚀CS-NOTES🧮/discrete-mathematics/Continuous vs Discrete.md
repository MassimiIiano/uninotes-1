The real number line is called **continuous**, because it is imagined to have no “holes”. 
The set of integers corresponds to a collection of points located at fixed intervals. 
Thus every integer is a real number, and because the integers are all separated from each other, the set of integers is called **discrete**.

The name **discrete mathematics** comes from the distinction between **continuous and discrete** mathematical objects. Typical discrete objects are integers, finite orders, trees, and graphs.
