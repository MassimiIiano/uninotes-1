# Report on: The mind behind Linux

## 1.0 Introduction
This report assets the TED talk "The mind behind Linux" and proposes it as supplemental learning material for CS students. In this ted talk Linus Torvalds, the original programmer behind the Linux kernel and the GIT distributed version control system, explains how making his project open source helped create two of the most important pillars of modern software.
## 2.1 Positive Aspects
1. `Relevance open source:` Computer Science students should know the benefits of open source licenses. Having a concrete example of how a single person project can, with the help of open source, so profoundly and positively affect the world is mind opening.
2. `Know a programming celebrity`: CS students should know Linus Torvalds, who created two of the most prominent software applications ever made.
## 2.2 Negative Aspects
The talk is structured as an interview and as such it could appear to be too focused on Linus Torvalds and not strictly an educational video.
## 3.0 Key Themes
1. `Transparency and sharing`:  Through openly sharing the source code with the community, programs which would have been forgotten could evolve into pillars of technology.
2. `Focus on concrete problems`:  Often computer scientist like to experiment with wildly new ideas, while it's often most effective focusing on the present and concrete or as Linus Torvalds puts it "I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in." 
## 4.0 Recommendation
I recommend the inclusion of "The mind behind Linux" in the educational material for introducing CS both to an engineering mindset and especially to introduce them to the open source world through a concrete example.

# The role of AI in art
Is AI generated content a good thing? There have been many controversies in the last years, nevertheless we don't know yet if it will have a positive or negative impact on humanity. This essay will discuss the possible benefits and drawbacks AI art could have in the future.

Firstly let's look at the benefits that AI generated content brings to the people. Nowadays everyone can create impressive images just by downloading a program and providing a simple written description of the picture they want to have. This is perfect for people who don't have many resources and don't care for the final picture to be perfect, such as drawings for a roleplaying game. Furthermore the quality of AI art will improve over time with advancements in the sector. Allowing everyone to cheaply produce beautiful artworks might be the greatest achievement of AI generated content.

On the other hand AI actively threatens entire industries. Who will commission drawings if they could get them faster and cheaper from a program. This does not mean there will be no more artists, although selling artwork especially on commission could become a lot more difficult in the future. 

Additionally there is the question of who owns the new Artwork. For now a US court ruled that no one can claim the copyright on an AI generated work, for the current algorithms basically use an advanced form of collage, still this could change in time and form nation to nation.

Overall, even with its drawbacks, giving everyone the opportunity to easily create beautiful artwork is worth the risk of losing a few jobs. In addition the current policy of negating the copyright of AI generated work hinder it to compete economically with current artists.
