Rising life expectancy in developed countries is causing some unwanted side effects. An overworked healthcare and unsustainable pensions are problems booth old and young have to recon with.
Here I will discuss the flaws of the current system, as well as potential short and long term solutions.

Our society is not build to support elderly people. When most of our Institution's where designed, governments where under the assumption that their workforce would continue to grow.
This false assumption leaves the economy and healthcare system somewhat understaffed and struggling to deliver on the needs of it's people, especially the ones reliant on pensions. In addition the extremaly high segregation present in most countries hinders a fair treatment for all citizen, instead favoring only the rich.

Nevertheless, there are some short and long-term solutions to address the above mentioned problems.
Replenishing the workforce through immigration or natural birth should allow our economy to better sustain retired people. It would also help to reform some institutions, like the health care system, to work more efficiently. However current social security systems do not guarantee fair living conditions. In order for everyone to live with dignity the state should work towards a basic universal income. As a result, other then tacking care of elderly in a more moral and humane way, it should also reduce inequality and discontent throughout the state.

In conclusion our social welfare needs to distance itself form the outdated believes of the old century and reform itself to ensure that everyone can live a dignified life.
