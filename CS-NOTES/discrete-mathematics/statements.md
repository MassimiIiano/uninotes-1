## Important mathematical statements

**A universal statement** says that a certain property is true for all elements in a collection of objects. (E.g., All positive numbers are greater than -10.)

**A conditional statement** says that if one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true. (E.g., If 378 is divisible by 18, then is divisible by 6 .)

Given a property that may or may not be true, an **existential statement** says that there is at least one thing for which the property is true. (E.g., *There is* a prime number that is even.)
### Universal conditional statements
A universal conditional statement is a statement that is both universal and conditional.
Example: “For all animals $a$, if $a$ is a dog, then $a$ is a mammal.”
### Existential universal statements
An existential universal statement is a statement that is primarily existential about an object we are seeking, and states something universal about this object.
Example: “There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer.”
### Example of a universal equivalence statement:
An equivalence statement, or if and only if (**iff**) statement says that one thing is true exactly in those cases where another thing is true. (E.g.,$22 + 3 = 2 × 11 + 3$ if and only if $22 = 2 × 11$.)
