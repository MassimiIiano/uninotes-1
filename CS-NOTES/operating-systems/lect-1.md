# what is a operating system

An operating system is a software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer. It provides a layer of abstraction between the user and the hardware, and it provides a set of services to the user. The operating system is the most fundamental software of a computer system, it is the first software that is loaded into the computer's memory, and it manages the computer's hardware from the moment it is turned on.
